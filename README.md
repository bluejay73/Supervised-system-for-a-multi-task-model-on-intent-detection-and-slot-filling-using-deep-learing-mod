# Supervised-system-for-a-multi-task-model-on-intent-detection-and-slot-filling-using-deep-learing-mod
Different Deep Learning models for supervised classification of intent and slot on universal dataset ATIS

All files are related to intent and slot detection using certain mechanism.
Different models have been used and different approcahes too.


All file are written in python2
 Dataset used is popular and a global one named ATIS.
 
 Different embedding approach are also used 
 1.w2v
 2.Glove
 
 Most of the work is done using keras.
 Nltk is used for preprocessing and for pos_tag approach.
 Jupyter notebook is mainly used for writing the codes so files are in .ipynb
